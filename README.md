# big-board-of-games

## P1 FIX NOW - End of June
Jerry
[ ] Scrape data for up to 1000 games
	[ ] Think of image storage (for each movie, there should be many images)
	[ ] Database points to images refs easier
[ ] Design home page
[ ] Design logo
[ ] set up social media
[ ] write content
[ ] article UI
[ ] take lots of pictures of games

Calvin
[ ] Figure out engineering stack
[ ] User profiles, discussion, forms

### MVP MVP - End of July
[ ] learn seo, pump out articles
[ ] images page
[ ] similar games api
[ ] basic recommendation app
[ ] link to games in the article
[ ] google analytics?

## MVP - Mid August
[ ] mailchimp
[ ] user accounts
[ ] users can rate games
[ ] forum or discussion or comments in game entry page
[ ] figure out some bug tracking software / site to replace this


## DONE
- [ ] Finalize Data format & Scrape
	- [ ] scraper needs to download the pictures into the assets archive
	- [ ] simplify the data formats, the '@objectid' and '#text' keys
	- [ ] Firebase s3-like service for image storage
- [ ] Finish Game entry UI page
- [ X ] Populate DB & game entry makes ajax request
[ ] consider not having images in the git repo (slows down commits	)
- [ ] set up landing page, with query input to return the game entry page for it
- [ ] JS vs db for data storage

incubator

User Flows
1. Fang
	- rating/rank + year, then genre, then playing time + # players + images, then description, the at the bottom is comments, then price
	- cares more about not buying duplicate games


2. Charlie
see if people like the game

ranking
how long to play -- number of players -- mechanics
pictures -- reviews (aggregation first, then skim)

description fits with first category but is generally weak

number of pieces
	-> pictures
balance (from reviews)
	ex. picking a race that's stronger than others
randomness



POST SCRAPE Processing
- rename @objectid to id
- rename #text to name
- rename (unix function) all image ext to png
- all description sections change <br/><br/> to newline
